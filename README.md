# To Do App With React Native

This project is a simple to-do application that I developed during the React Native learning process. 

## Features
- You can add any task you want without any limits. 
- You complete the task with the first long press on the task cards. The styles of the task card are changing. 
- The second long time you press the task card, the task is completely deleted from the list. 
- The app shows the number of your unfinished tasks at the top right.
